Track Issues Here

I think we can track issues here, it's more easier than email...for me at least.

What do you think?

I think we can use the git track issue. and we can try to open one issue for each
issue.... we can open for example:

- Upload issue...

So we would use to track "issues" not for like normal comunication like what time we will get together. or anything else but only talking about the issue... 

by the way I will be online at 6PM if you can be online good if not i will commit the changes I will do...

I think git will be great to track issues.. but we might need a better way to handle normal comunication I still like email, saves, and date everything, and i can always get back even in 5 years from now.. haha

I saw the changes you made we are doing a good job I am really happy about this project later today I try start work in the shopping cart while you keep going with the creator.

I think commicate in this will create a problem with our commit log, because we will have many committes that are not relate to change in the code.

thanks
